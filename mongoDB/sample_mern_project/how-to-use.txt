MongoDB setup
———————

Before starting the app, ensure that we have a MongoDB server running on localhost on default port 27017.
The MongoDB server should have :
 - an "appdev" user with the "readWriteAnyDatabase" permission defined in the "admin" database
 - a "shop" database
 - a "products" collection in the "shop" database
 - some products in that collection
 - a "users" collection in the "shop" database
 - a unique index on email on the "users" collection


Commands to run i nthe MongoDB Shell to prepare the MongoDB server :

use admin
db.createUser({user: "appdev", pwd: "appdev", roles: ["readWriteAnyDatabase"]})

use shop
db.products.insertMany([
